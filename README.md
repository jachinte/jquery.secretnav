##Â AMD

SecretNav can also be used with [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).

## Theming

SecretNav comes with a basic styling. If you want to customize the appearance you can modify the styles in [src/sass/jquery.secretnav.scss](src/sass/jquery.secretnav.scss), and then re-run the grunt command to generate the distribution files again.
